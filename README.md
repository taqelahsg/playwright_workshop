## 💡 Workshop Tips

### For Instructors

1. **Pace yourself** - Don't rush through fundamentals
2. **Hands-on first** - Let students code before explaining concepts
3. **Use headed mode** - Always show browser when demonstrating
4. **Encourage experimentation** - Breaking things is part of learning
5. **Live code** - Type code live rather than copy-paste
6. **Take breaks** - Every 60-90 minutes
7. **Check understanding** - Ask questions frequently

### For Students

1. **Type the code** - Don't just copy-paste
2. **Read error messages** - They're very helpful
3. **Use headed mode** - See what's happening with `--headed`
4. **Experiment** - Try changing values
5. **Ask questions** - No question is too basic
6. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts
7. **Practice more** - Repeat labs if needed

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know TypeScript?
Basic JavaScript is sufficient. You'll learn TypeScript concepts as you go.

### Can I use JavaScript instead of TypeScript?
Yes! All examples work in JavaScript. Just rename `.ts` files to `.js`.

### Which browser do I need?
None! Playwright installs and manages browsers automatically.

### How much does Playwright cost?
Playwright is completely free and open-source.

### Can I test mobile apps?
Playwright tests web apps in mobile browsers (emulation). For native apps, consider Appium.

### Is Playwright better than Selenium?
Playwright offers modern features like auto-wait, better reliability, and easier setup. Both are excellent tools.
