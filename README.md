## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know TypeScript?
Basic JavaScript is sufficient. Complete Module 1 if you need a refresher.

### Can I use JavaScript instead of TypeScript?
Yes! All examples work in JavaScript. Just rename `.ts` files to `.js`.

### Which browser do I need?
None! Playwright installs and manages browsers automatically.

### How much does Playwright cost?
Playwright is completely free and open-source.

### What is Claude Code?
Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered CLI tool for code generation and assistance. It's used in Module 8 to build frameworks rapidly.

### Can I test mobile apps?
Playwright tests web apps in mobile browsers (emulation). For native apps, consider Appium.

### Is Playwright better than Selenium?
Playwright offers modern features like auto-wait, better reliability, and easier setup. Both are excellent tools.
