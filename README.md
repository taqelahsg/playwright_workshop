## 💡 Workshop Tips

### For Instructors

1. **Pace yourself** - Don't rush through fundamentals
2. **Hands-on first** - Let students code before explaining concepts
3. **Use headed mode** - Always show browser when demonstrating
4. **Encourage experimentation** - Breaking things is part of learning
5. **Live code** - Type code live rather than copy-paste
6. **Take breaks** - Every 60-90 minutes
7. **Check understanding** - Ask questions frequently

### For Students

1. **Type the code** - Don't just copy-paste
2. **Read error messages** - They're very helpful
3. **Use headed mode** - See what's happening with `--headed`
4. **Experiment** - Try changing values
